# painter

A "painter" program created with Java Swing. Allows user to draw rectangles, ellipses, and triangles.

To draw, click and drag the mouse in the window. Select different shapes with the buttons on the left. Colors are randomly selected, and pressing enter re-selects the colors.

Click on a shape to bring it to the front. Press backspace to delete the selected shape.

In a later version of this program, I made it so that you could use the arrow keys to re-order shapes and I made it more clear when a shape was selected. Unfortunately I seem to have lost that file.

# Features

A LinkedList that I built myself from scratch (it's not better than the built in Java one, but hey). Colorful shapes.
